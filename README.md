# lex-electrumrpc-client

A lightweight client for connecting via RPC to an electrum bitcoin wallet.

Attention! Use this library only on a single local machine with an Electrum wallet! For security reasons, you should exclude the possibility of accessing the RPC interface of the Electrum wallet from the network.
